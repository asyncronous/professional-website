                My journey into tech started after exploring a few different career paths and discovering a love for programming through Unity and C#. I quickly realised I wanted to pursue software engineering professionally, so I completed an accelerated Full Stack Web Development course with Coder Academy, covering:
                <ul>
                    <li>Computer Science fundamentals</li>
                    <li>Terminal, Git, Bash scripting</li>
                    <li>HTML, CSS, SCSS</li>
                    <li>Ruby, Rails</li>
                    <li>JavaScript, React, Node, Express</li>
                    <li>Cypress, Mocha/Chai</li>
                    <li>MongoDB, PostgreSQL</li>
                </ul>
                Since 2020, I‚Äôve been working full time as a Software Engineer, with several years at Domino‚Äôs. My work there has focused on backend .NET microservices, cloud migrations (Azure, AWS), DevOps automation, and global platform modernisation. I‚Äôve led projects upgrading legacy systems to .NET 6/8, automated translation workflows, built SQL deployment pipelines, and enabled cross-team adoption of new tools. My experience spans:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cloud platforms: Azure, AWS</li>
                    <li>Backend: .NET 6/8, Node.js, GraphQL</li>
                    <li>DevOps: CI/CD, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions</li>
                    <li>Frontend: React, HTML/CSS</li>
                    <li>Database: SQL Server, CosmosDB</li>
                    <li>Translation/localisation automation</li>
                    <li>Technical documentation & onboarding</li>
                </ul>
                I‚Äôm recognised for my technical breadth, reliability, and collaborative approach in high-impact, multi-region projects. I enjoy designing and implementing code across the stack, driving continuous improvement, and supporting global teams.

                Outside of work, I‚Äôm still working on my original game project (dev site coming soon), and occasionally write fiction set in the same universe (<Link to="/book" className="nav-link HyperGold">here</Link>). I also enjoy photography‚Äîcheck out my <Link to="/gallery" className="nav-link HyperGold">Gallery</Link> for some travel shots.
